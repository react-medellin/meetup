Hi React Medellín,

My name is Miguel, I'm from Madrid and I'm the CTO of an ed-tech company in New York, iblstudios.com. We're looking for a React engineer to work remotely, either part-time (anywhere from two to five hours per day) or full-time.

The job consists of extending the world's largest learning management system for MOOCs, Open edX, through a series of personalized views and dashboards for students, instructors and administrators via React and, potentially, other Javascript libraries.

The salary will range from $20 to $30 USD per hour (depending on your experience with React and Javascript), and we'll come to an agreement regarding the number of hours that works for you. We'd like to conduct a paid test during the first week and go from there.

If you're interested, please contact us at careers@ibleducation.com with a brief description in English or Spanish of who you are, what your objectives as a software engineer are, as well as code samples.
